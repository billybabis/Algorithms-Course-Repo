Simple Python implementations of popular algorithms from a college course

Algorithms Course 2015 - Boston College
These independent Python files are simple implementations of ubiquitous complex algorithms. I recommend reading about each Algorithm online before trying to comprehend my code, although I do provide some in-depth explanations.

1) binaryHeap.py - Binary Heap! 
2) discreteFourierTransform.py - Discrete Fourier Transform!
3) lineBreaking.py - a dynamic programming problem
4) Kruskal's Algorithm - finding the shortest path among all nodes in a graph
5) Ford Fulkerson Algorithm - maximize flow in a weighted graph
